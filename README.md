📝 AI Prompt Optimizer
This project is a simple web application built with Streamlit that helps users transform their raw ideas into detailed, effective prompts for AI models. It acts as a "prompt engineer," taking a short, high-level request and expanding it into a well-structured and comprehensive prompt to get better results from large language models.

✨ Features
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and simple Streamlit interface for easy input and output.

Prompt Engineering: Uses a large language model to optimize and refine user prompts.

Clear Output: Displays the generated, optimized prompt for the user to copy and use.

⚙️ Setup and Installation
